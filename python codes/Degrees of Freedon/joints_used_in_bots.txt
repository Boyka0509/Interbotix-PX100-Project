1. Revolute joints - 
   - like a door hinge with one DOF
   - The positive direction about the axis can be found using the right habd thumb rule 

2. Linear Joint / Sliding Robots:
   - provided linear motion between two rigid bodies
   - one DOF

3. Universal Joints:
    - two revolute joint axes orthogonal to each other
    - it can provide two rotational DOF's around roll(x) and pitch(y)

4. Spherical Joints:
    - ball and socket
    - 3 DOFS

5. Cylindrical Joints: 
    - a joint tha can provide independent translational and rotation about a single fixed joint axis
    - it has 2DOf's

6. Helical Joints:
    - a screw joint that provides a simultaneous rotation and translation about a screw axis 
    - 1 DOF
